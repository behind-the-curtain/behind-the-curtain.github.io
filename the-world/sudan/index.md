## Sudan

We’ve been given the privilege to humbly serve and love our world. In as much as we utilize our resources (time, treasure & talent) to love those in need, it’s not a one-sided exchange. More times then not our perspective needs adjustment.  God focuses our eyes and bends our ears to who He is and what He’s truly about as we serve people in other parts of the world. For the past year we have been actively supporting entrepreneurs in South Sudan.  It starts with a life, impacts a family and transforms a community.  Seed Effect is a “Credit with Education” micro-finance initiative that plants seeds that overcome poverty by empowering the poor with access to micro-loans and spiritual discipleship.
