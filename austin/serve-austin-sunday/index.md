## Serve Austin Sunday

We live in an incredible city.  We love it. By serving this city we hope to make Christ’s name known and spread his love in a tangible way.  The Grove sets out to love people and to make Austin a better city.  We have primarily focused on the needs of the homeless, refugees, human trafficking victims & inner city children as a means to spread God’s love as a community.  Our hope is to expand on our efforts to meet even more needs through  love of Christ.
