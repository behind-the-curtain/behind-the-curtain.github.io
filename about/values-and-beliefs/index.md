## Values

The Grove values many things.  In fact, there are too many to name.  So we've resolved to narrow it down to 3 for starters…

#### Love

It was love that motivated the Father to send His son. It was love that went to the cross. It was love that defeated the grave. It is love that calls us. It is love that saves us. Our desire is to love the one who first loved us. Our desire is to love the Lord above all – above our families, above our careers, above our pleasure; above ourselves. And secondary to our love for Him is our love for others. We are called to love others and to imitate Christ.  Our desire is to be known by this love.

#### Freedom

We have been freed. Freed from slavery to sin. Freed from oppression. Freed from darkness.  Freed from living in fear of death.  Freed from living aimlessly without an eternal purpose. We have been freed so that we can live not for ourselves but for Christ. This freedom was birthed by the work and sacrifice of Jesus on our behalf. It's this message of freedom we proclaim.

#### Austin

We love this city and we are committed to it's unique culture and its people. We are “for” the culture of Austin. Meaning, we choose to engage it so that Christ can use us to transform it.  We are “for” this city that we love.


## Beliefs

The Bible [all the books of the Old and New Testaments] is the true written message of God to us. We believe the authors of the Bible were inspired by God and are therefore completely trustworthy. The Bible is the final authority on all matters of life & faith.

There is one God, who exists forever in perfect community as three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

Jesus Christ is fully man and fully God. He is the perfect reflection of God's character and glory. He lived a sinless life and offered himself as the only perfect sacrifice for the sins of all people by dying on the cross. All who believe in Him are declared righteous on the basis of His death. He rose physically from the dead and will return again to the earth to reign forever with those who are His.

The Holy Spirit persuades us to repent of our sins and confess Jesus as Lord. He lives in us, teaches us, gifts us, comforts us and enables us to live godly lives.

Men and women are created in the image of God, but each one has fallen short of God's perfect standard. As a result, men and women are dead in their sins and are in need of salvation.

Salvation from our sinful condition is a free gift from God to us. It is not something we earn or deserve. It is offered in grace and received by faith in Jesus Christ alone. Those who believe in Jesus Christ and call on His name are made right with God and given eternal life.

The Church is the living Body of Christ on earth; Christ is its head and source of life. The Body is composed of those who have received Him personally. The Church exists to celebrate the living God, cultivate personal growth in Christ, love one another in Christ, and communicate Christ to the world through words and deeds.

Jesus Christ will return to earth to raise the dead, judge the world, and establish His glorious Kingdom. This is the hope of the Church and its encouragement for ministry. At the end of time the redeemed will go on to eternal life.

Baptism is a testimony to sin and the resurrection to a new life after accepting Christ as personal Savior. The Lord's Supper is a time of thanksgiving and communion with Christ, setting forth in sacred and symbolic manner the death of the Lord Jesus Christ and the unity of His Church; all true believers and only believers should share in it.
