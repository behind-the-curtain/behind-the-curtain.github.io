## Serving

At the Grove we believe we are called to serve our families, our communities, and the world. This is an overflow of the love that Jesus shows us, and we are privileged to be involved in several different areas of service.

> &ldquo;By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.&rdquo; John 13:35
