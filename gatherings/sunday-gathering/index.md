## Sunday Gathering

This is the gathering of the entire church to celebrate God – to worship Him and to speak of all He’s done, is doing and is going to do.

The Grove Sunday gathering is an expectant gathering where we seek and respond to God.

Because of who God is and all he has done, we always have a reason to celebrate him. We gather as a community each week with an expectation that he will meet us, and desire that he will change us as we seek him and allow him to confront our lives with his truth.
If you are looking for a church community to step into, or if you are interested in finding out more about our church, or if you have questions about God, we invite you to join us for our Sunday Gathering.

**Audio of the Sunday messages is available [here][messages].**
