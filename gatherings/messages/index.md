   they're significant in this message on [Luke 7][].

 - **[October 20, 2013][20131020]** - We spent more time covering Jesus's words
   on judgement in [Luke 6][].

 - **[October 13, 2013][20131013]** - We talked about what Jesus has to say
   about judgement in [Luke 6][].

 - **[October 6, 2013][20131006]** - Jesus told us to love our enemies in [Luke
