## Jesus

There has been none like Jesus. Jesus was born roughly two thousand years ago. He lived in a small rural town. He was raised by a young mother and His father was a blue collar working carpenter. Jesus had brothers and sisters. For the first 3 decades of his life, he lived a relatively normal, uneventful life working with his hands.

Around 30 years old, his life takes a turn. He begins to preach, teach, and heal. He never traveled more than a few hundred miles from his home. He never got married and never had children. He lived a simple life with many of those years as homeless, living off the hospitality of others.

Yet, what we find today is that Jesus…there have been none like him. He is the most significant person who has ever lived in the history of the world. There are more songs that have been sung to him, more paintings painted of him, and more books written regarding him than anyone who has ever lived in the history of the world. Today and through out history, millions of people worship him as Lord, God, Savior, Christ, and King.

There is no one who has transformed the world like Jesus. He’s worth getting to know.

> &ldquo;But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished— he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.&rdquo; Romans 3:21-26
