# Announcements for October 6, 2013

 - **No grill-out downtown this week**: Normally we do a grill-out for homeless
   folks downtown on the first Sunday of the month, but we won't be able to do
   so this month since the parking lot is taken for ACL.

 - **Fill It, Give It Backpack Event**: When we did our backpack drive we had a
   massive donation, so we're going to fill 50 of the backpacks with supplies
   that could help our homeless friends on the street. The "Filling" event is
   going to be at 9 A.M. before service next Sunday, October 13th. We will
   provide breakfast treats and coffee!

   The "Giving" part is up to you &mdash; you will take a backpack and keep it
   in your car until you see someone in need, and then give it &#9786;

   We need to collect the supplies *before* the filling event next Sunday.
   Talk to Jen to sign up for individual items, or if you prefer, you may
   donate cash as well.

   Contact [Jen Interiano][jen] if you have any questions.

 - **New location for the Montgomery's small group** - The Montgomery's
   community group is meeting at the normal time, 7:30 P.M. on Thursday, but
   will meet at [Opal Divine's][opal] on South Congress.

 - **Explore God groups**: [Explore God][explore] is a movement among many
   believers in our area to create open dialog about faith and Jesus with
   anyone who has questions. If you'd like to get involved in a group, a couple
   options are:

   - [**Baker Street Pub Meetup**][baker] - [Contact Reid][baker] for more
     info.

   - [**Irie Bean Meetup**][irie] - Contact [Oscar Interiano][oscar] for
     details.

 - **Men's Group**: Reuben and Sam are leading a men's group focused on
   accountability. It meets from 7-9 PM on Tuesdays at Reuben's place. Contact
   [Reuben][] for more details.
