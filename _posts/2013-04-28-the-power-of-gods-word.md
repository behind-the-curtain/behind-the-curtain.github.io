## There’s great power in God’s Word

This week has been one of those weeks…it got the best of me. I was looking back and thinking about the time I snapped at a coworker instead of patiently responding, my anxiety when some plans fell through, getting sick and not having time to be sick and my overall stress level. It wasn’t good. The sad part, I can pinpoint the source of where I went off the tracks. I couldn’t have changed the circumstances, but how I responded to them could have been very different. I didn’t stay focused on the Lord. I simply didn’t read my Bible. For me, it’s that practical! When I read God’s Word and focus my life on Him I experience His power daily. It keeps me focused on the most important and those around me benefit from it. There’s great power in God’s Word.

So I wanted to share a Bible reading plan that I found that has been really helpful for me and has changed the typical way I’ve read the Bible in the past. Here’s the deal, read 10 chapters a day – One chapter a day from each list below. I know…I know…it seems like a lot, but it’s not! It’s 30-45 minutes a day depending on how fast you read. Here’s the description of it below:

“On day one, you read Matthew 1, Genesis 1, Romans 1, and so forth. On day 2, read Matthew 2, Genesis 2, etc. On day 29, you will have just finished Matthew, so go to Mark 1 on the Gospel list; you’ll also be almost to the end of 2nd Corinthians and Proverbs, you’ll be reading Psalm 29 and Genesis 29,and so forth. When you reach the last chapter of the last book in a list – start over again. Rotate all the way through all the Scriptures constantly.”

“Since the lists vary in length, the readings begin interweaving constantly changing ways. You will NEVER read the same set of ten chapters together again! Every year you’ll read through all the Gospels four times, the Pentateuch twice,Paul’s letters 4-5 times each, the OT wisdom literature six times, all the Psalms at least twice, all the Proverbs as well as Acts a dozen times, and all the way through the OT History and Prophetic books about 1 ½ times. Since the interweaving is constantly changing, you will experience the Bible commenting on itself in constantly changing ways.”

List 1 (89 days)
Matthew, Mark, Luke, John

List 2 (187 days)
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy

List 3 (78 days)
Romans, I&II Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Hebrews

List 7 (31 days)
Proverbs

List 8 (249 days)

List 9 (250 days)
Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi

List 10 (28 days)

I encourage you to try this for 30 days and see what happens. My guess is that it’ll be a great experience in growing you closer to the Lord.
