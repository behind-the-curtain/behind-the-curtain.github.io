# Announcements for September 29, 2013

 - **Serving the homeless downtown next week**: Next Sunday, October
   6<sup>th</sup>, we'll be downtown at [7<sup>th</sup> and Neches][lot] at 3
   P.M. to grill burgers and pass them out to anyone who is hungry. Come join
   us!

 - **Fill It, Give It Backpack Event**: When we did our backpack drive we had a
   massive donation, so we're going to fill 50 of the backpacks with supplies
   that could help our homeless friends on the street. The "Filling" event is
   going to be at 9 A.M. before service on October 13th. We will provide
   breakfast treats and coffee!

   The "Giving" part is up to you &mdash; you will take a backpack and keep it
   in your car until you see someone in need, and then give it &#9786;

   We need to collect the supplies *before* the filling event on the 9th. There
   is a sign up sheet at the service for individual items, or if you prefer,
   you may donate cash as well.

   Contact [Jen Interiano][jen] if you have any questions.

 - **Yard Games at the Stacy's** - The Montgomery's community group is meeting
   at [the Stacy's][stacys] Thursday at 7:30 for yard games. Don't bother
   coming unless you bring your A game.

   believers in our area to create open dialog about faith and Jesus with
