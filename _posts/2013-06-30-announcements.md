# Announcements for June 13, 2013

 - **Serving the homeless downtown**: Next week is the first Sunday of the
   month, so that means we'll be downtown at 7th and Neches at 3pm to grill
   burgers and pass them out to anyone who is hungry. There's always the danger
   that we're forced to change plans because of the parking lot availability,
   so check back here and on Facebook.

 - **Tacos in the park**: Come join us at the South end of [Ramsey
   Park](http://www.austinparks.org/our-parks.html?parkid=316) on Saturday
   morning, July 13th at 10 AM. It's a fun time for families and there's a good
   chance we'll break out into a game of ultimate frisbee or basketball.
