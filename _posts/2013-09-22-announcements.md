# Announcements for September 22, 2013

 - **Ladies Community Group**: This Wednesday at 8:15 PM on top of Whole Foods
   downtown.

 - **Fill It, Give It Backpack Event**: On October 13<sup>th</sup> at 9 AM at
   Zilker Elementary, we are having a drive for our homeless friends on the
   street. We have fifty backpacks, and our goal is to have volunteers fill
   them with basic need items and keep them in their car, and when they see
   someone in need, hand them the backpack. There is a sign up sheet today at
   our gathering, and more details to follow.

 - **Explore God groups**: [Explore God][explore] is a movement among many
   believers in our area to create open dialog about faith and Jesus with
   anyone who has questions. If you'd like to get involved in a group, a couple
   options are:

   - [**Baker Street Pub Meetup**][baker] - [Contact Reid][baker] for more
     info.

   - [**Irie Bean Meetup**][irie] - Contact [Oscar Interiano][oscar] for
     details.

 - **Men's Group**: Reuben and Sam are leading a men's group focused on
   accountability. It meets from 7-9 PM on Tuesdays at Reuben's place. Contact
   [Reuben][] for more details.

 - **Mission Trip to Kenya**: Steven will be leading a mission trip to Kenya in
   January.  It will be an awesome chance to step out of your comfort zone and
   share the gospel. Contact Steven for more info.
