# Announcements for November 17, 2013

 - **Collecting winter clothes for the homeless** - The first Sunday of every
   month we head downtown and grill burgers for anyone that's hungry. We won't
   be back down there for a couple weeks, but it's getting cold out, so we want
   to collect winter clothes to distribute as well. If you have any, please
   plan on brining them to the grill-out on December 1<sup>st</sup>, or the
   gathering if you that's easier for you. If you have any questions,
   contact [Steven][].

 - **Community groups** - Community groups are the heart and soul of The Grove
   and we've got several meeting this week, so head over to the [community
   group page][cgs] and check one out.
