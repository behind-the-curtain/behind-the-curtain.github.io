# Announcements for November 10, 2013

 - **Hangout in the park after our gathering today** - After church we'll be
   hanging out in the picnic area behind the school near the basketball courts.
   Feel free to pick up lunch and enjoy everyone's company for a bit!

 - **Community groups** - Community groups are the heart and soul of The Grove
   and we've got several meeting this week, so head over to the [community
   group page][cgs] and check one out.
