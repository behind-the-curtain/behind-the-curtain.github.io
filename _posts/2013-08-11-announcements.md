# Announcements for August 11, 2013

 - **Backpack and School Supply Drive for Zilker Elementary**: We're collecting
   backpacks and school supplies for families of children that might need them
   at Zilker Elementary.

   The school informed us that the greatest need is for 3rd-5th grade, but
   supplies for any age are welcomed. Backpacks should be gently used or new
   (no wheels please). Please don't feel obligated to get all items on list.
   You are welcome to bring just a few supplies, just a backpack or fill a
   backpack with items. Anything will be appreciated.

   [List of supplies the students need][supplies].

 - **Montgomery's Community Group Game Night** - The Montgomery's community
   group will be having a game night this Thursday at 7:30 PM! Location TBD.
