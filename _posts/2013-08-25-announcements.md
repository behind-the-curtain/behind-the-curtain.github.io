# Announcements for August 25, 2013

 - **Last chance to give to the Backpack and School Supply Drive for Zilker

   children that might need them at Zilker Elementary. [Click here for more

 - **Serving the homeless downtown in two weeks**: On September 8<sup>th</sup>
   we'll be downtown at [7<sup>th</sup> and Neches][lot] at 3 PM to grill
   burgers and pass them out to anyone who is hungry. Normally we do this on
   the first Sunday of each month, but we're pushing it back a week this month
   because of Labor Day.  Come join us!

 - **Movie night at Irie Bean** - We are doing another movie night 8 PM on
   Friday, September 6<sup>th</sup> at [Irie Bean Coffee Bar][irie]. This time
   we'll be watching The Princess Bride. Bring a friend and enjoy!

 - **August Church is joining us for a few months** - A brand new church plant
   will be joining us in their beginning phases as they grow their community.
   We're blessed to have them with us, so make a point to find some of them and
   say hi.
