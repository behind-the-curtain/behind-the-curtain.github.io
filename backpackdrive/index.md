**When**: Between now and August 25th.

**Where**: At our Sunday morning gatherings at 10 AM at [Zilker Elementary][zilker].

**What**: We're collecting backpacks filled with school supplies for the upcoming year. These backpacks will be distributed to families in need in our community.

[**Here's a complete list of school supplies**][supplies].

The school informed us that the greatest need is for 3rd-5th grade, but supplies for any age are welcomed. Backpacks should be gently used or new (no wheels please). Please don't feel obligated to get all items on list. You are welcome to bring just a few supplies, just a backpack or fill a backpack with items. Anything will be appreciated.

**Let's give back to the school that we call home!**
