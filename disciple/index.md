## Disciple

A disciple is a &ldquo;learner.&rdquo; That’s what the word means. A disciple is someone in pursuit of becoming like Jesus in every way. Jesus took on his disciples to teach them what He knew, showing them what to do so that they could do what He did.  Jesus said in Matthew 28:18-20…

> “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

With all the authority of heaven & earth, Jesus gave His followers the instruction to make disciples and baptize.  That’s it.  Scripture clearly affirms that God is the one who changes the hearts of people, not people.  That frees us up in our posture to be known by our love, the same way Jesus was known by His love. But, before we can be obedient to His command we have to be disciples ourselves. This is more than sharing the Gospel, this is more than someone accepting Christ and believing in Him. This isn’t a random assortment of facts and propositions and behaviors that we need to know. Discipleship is something that is who we are to the core – following Jesus and not holding anything back.

This is the foundation of the Grove. We are striving to be a learners of Christ – a Disciple.  We want to be a community that strives together and is increasing in our love for God and in our love for people.  The beautiful thing is that it’s not homogenous.  We’re all in different places, but pursuing the same God revealed in Jesus.
